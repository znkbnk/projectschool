    { title: "Are React class components deprecated?", content: "Component is the base class for the React components defined as JavaScript classes. Class components are still supported by React, but we don’t recommend using them in new code." },
    { title: "Are React and React.js the same?", content: "Truly, the difference between React and React JS is purely in the naming. React is the official name used consistently in documentation and by the developer community. Meanwhile, React JS is a less formal term highlighting Reacts connection to JavaScript." },
    { title: "Are React and React native similar?", content: "React and React Native are both JavaScript frameworks created by Meta that are similar in some ways, but have key differences: Purpose, Features, Syntax, Lifecycle methods, Cost, Realease Process, Sharing code. React Native gives developers better access to a mobile OSs native features, which allows for the development of native-looking apps using a web application language syntax." },
    { title: "Are React developers in demand?", content: "Yes, React developers are in high demand. In the United Kingdom, the average base salary for a ReactJS developer is £55,000 per year, but salaries can vary depending on location, experience, and company size. If youre interested in becoming a React developer, you can build a portfolio of your work to showcase your skills and expertise. You can also use open-source tools like React to create and manage projects independently." },
    { title: "Are React and Angular similar?", content: "React and Angular are both popular front-end frameworks with similar features, but they have some key differences: Architecture, Data binding, DOM, Popularity, Ecosystem, Learning Curve. Both frameworks also offer extensive documentation and tutorials, and the Ionic framework can be used to build web and mobile apps using either React or Angular. " },
    { title: "Are React hooks async?", content: "useState is an asynchronous hook and it doesnt change the state immediately, it has to wait for the component to re-render. useRef is a synchronous hook that updates the state immediately and persists its value through the components lifecycle, but it doesnt trigger a re-render." },
    { title: "Can React native be used for web?", content: "It can be used in new and existing apps, web-only and multi-platform apps. React Native for Web uses React DOM to accurately render React Native compatible JavaScript code in a web browser." },
    { title: "Can React native be used for ios?", content: "React Native lets you write code once and deploy it to both iOS and Android devices. It`s based on React, so you`ll be familiar with the syntax, and it uses native components so your app will look and feel like a native app. In this tutorial, we`ll show you how to get started with React Native and build a simple app." },
    { title: "Can React be used for backend?", content: "React JS, primarily known for frontend development, has also gained traction in the backend realm. Its versatility allows developers to build powerful server-side applications with ease. In backend development, React JS can be utilized to create interactive user interfaces and manage data flow efficiently." },
    { title: "Can I use React for mobile apps?", content: "React Native is a mobile application development framework designed to work on Android or iOS devices. ReactJS is easy to use, and it makes creating complex user interfaces simpler. React Native is fast and smooth, which makes it a good choice for developing mobile apps. Both ReactJS and React Native are open-source." },
    { title: "Can React be used for mobile apps?", content: "React Native is a mobile application development framework designed to work on Android or iOS devices. ReactJS is easy to use, and it makes creating complex user interfaces simpler. React Native is fast and smooth, which makes it a good choice for developing mobile apps. Both ReactJS and React Native are open-source." },
    { title: "Can React native be used for desktop?", content: "Yes, React Native can be used to create desktop applications for Windows, macOS, and Linux." },
    { title: "Can you have multiple useEffects in React?", content: "Yes, you can use multiple useEffect hooks in one component. This allows you to separate unrelated logic into distinct effects, making your code easier to understand and test." },
    { title: "Can you modify React props?", content: "Props are read-only snapshots in time: every render receives a new version of props. You can't change props. When you need interactivity, you'll need to set state." },
    { title: "Can a React hook useEffect be async?", content: "useEffect has nothing to do with async code. It is specifically for triggering side effects when your React state changes. That being said, you can call async functions inside a useEffect and that's fine." },
    { title: "Can we pass a function as a prop in React?", content: "Props might remind you of HTML attributes, but you can pass any JavaScript value through them, including objects, arrays, and functions." },
    { title: "Can React Hooks return a component?", content: "By returning a component from a hook, some implementation details can be hidden, improving the readability and maintainability of the code. On sometimes, returning a component from a hook may be more practical than passing it several props." },
    { title: "Can you await React setState?", content: "The setState function in React does not return a promise, so it cannot be awaited. React's design does not support the await keyword for state updates. Instead, developers should use the callback function or the useEffect hook to handle actions waiting for a state update." },
    { title: "Can you use a for loop in React?", content: "Yes, you can use a for loop in React components to iterate over data and dynamically render elements." },
    { title: "Is React easy for beginners?", content: "Thankfully, React is easy to learn, but only once you have foundational knowledge in JavaScript. Of course, the difficulty that comes with learning anything new is somewhat subjective. Regardless of your prior experience, plenty of resources are available to help make React easier to learn." },
    { title: "How does React work for dummies?", content: "React is a javascript framework that allows you to create really complex user-interfaces. React works by breaking down objects into pieces of code called Components. Components take in parameters called props (properties) & return a hierarchy of views to display via the render method." },
    { title: "How to make a React for role in Discord?", content: "Create Roles, Download Carl-bot, Authorize Carl-bot to join your server, Choose what permissions to give to Carl-bot, Navigate to the “Reaction Roles” section and start adding your emojis, Assign emojis to all of your roles, then click create, Verify that your Reaction Roles message has been created, Click on an emoji to react and enjoy your new role." },
    { title: "Should I use forEach or map in React?", content: "forEach() is quite faster than map() as it doesn't return anything. Hence, inside any functions that don't need any return value and requires manipulation only, use forEach() , but if looping is needed inside a jsx to return a new array, use map() ." },
    { title: "Can you use TypeScript with React?", content: "All production-grade React frameworks offer support for using TypeScript. Follow the framework specific guide for installation: Next.js." },
    { title: "Is Django good with React?", content: "If you can't decide between the two, you can also use React with Django by integrating React in Django as a front-end library. Using the two together provides a clear separation of concerns and gives you the advantages of each. Using both will allow you to build a more maintainable and scalable application." },
    { title: "Are React and React Native the same?", content: "React utilizes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create interactive user interfaces, whereas React Native utilizes APIs and native UI components to build mobile applications. React. js used a virtual DOM to render browser code in React, whereas React Native uses Native API to render components for mobile applications." },
    { title: "Can I use React with NodeJS?", content: "Single Language for Front-end and Back-end: Using Node and React together, developers avoid the need to learn complex back-end languages like Python or Ruby. They can use Node for server-side development and React for front-end coding seamlessly, saving resources, money, and time." },
    { title: "Can I use next js with React?", content: "Next.js is a React framework that gives you building blocks to create web applications. By framework, we mean Next.js handles the tooling and configuration needed for React, and provides additional structure, features, and optimizations for your application." },
    { title: "Are Next.js and ReactJS the same?", content: "React is a flexible JavaScript library focused purely on building user interfaces, while Next. js is an opinionated framework that builds on React and provides extra functionality like server-side rendering and optimization features out of the box." },
    { title: "Can you use Python with React?", content: "React, a powerful JavaScript library, is a perfect companion for React Python development." },
    { title: "Is React and Python a good combination?", content: "Sure, that combination works just fine but since React is coded in Javascript, you might consider using ExpressJs so that you're only working in Javascript vs. 2 different languages." },
